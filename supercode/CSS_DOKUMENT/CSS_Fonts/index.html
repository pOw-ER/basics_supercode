  <p>I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be. Keep your mind
    limber. Tonight's the night. <strong> And it's going to happen again and again.</strong> <em> It has to happen.</em>
    I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am.</p>
  <h2>I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister.</h2>
  <p>Cops, another community I'm not part of. Like a sloth. I can do that. Like a sloth. I can do that. I'm partial to
    air conditioning. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen.</p>

    <li>I'm generally confused most of the time.</li>
    <li>Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.</li>

  <h3>Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter.</h3>
  <p>I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be. I'm really more an

  <p>Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. You're a killer. I catch
    killers. Like a sloth. I can do that. Hello, Dexter Morgan. God created pudding, and then he rested.</p>
  <p>This man is a knight in shining armor. I'm really more an apartment person. Tell him time is of the essence. God
    created pudding, and then he rested. He taught me a code. To survive.</p>

  <p>Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the
    world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be. I'm doing mental jumping jacks.</p>

  <p>Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. God created pudding, and then he
    rested. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the
    years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.</p>

    This is fun. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With
    my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.</p>
